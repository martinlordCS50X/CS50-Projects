# CS50 Projects
**By Martin Lord**                                                    
All my coding projects from Harvard's CS50X, CS50P, and CS50AI, which are runnable.
## How to use projects
  Inside this repository is 3 directories, one for each Harvard CS50 course I took that had coding projects, 
each containing a sub-directory for each project. Inside the sub-directories, there is a file labeled
``instructions.txt`` that contains instructions for running each program, as well as a description of the
program. The instructions may be lines of ``BASH`` script, which requires a computer running Linux or a
Virtual Machine (VM). ~To be honest, I don't have time right now to figure out how to run my projects in
Windows or MacOS command line script...~
